			 The veriT SMT solver
	      Compilation and installation instructions


1. PREREQUISITES

The installation process automatically downloads third-party software
(minisat and the GNU MP library)s, so you need an active Internet
connection to install veriT.

The following tools are used in the installation process:
# gcc, g++: compilers
# make, ar, ranlib: build process
# wget, tar, patch: to fetch GMP and Minisat
# bison, flex, m4: build compilers and preprocessing

2. CUSTOMIZATION

The build process is customizable through settings found in the file
Makefile.config:

- The default settings of the build process installs the binaries in
directory $HOME/bin.  Edit file Makefile.config to change the
installation directory.

- Proof production is disabled by default. Edit file Makefile.config to
turn on proof production capabilities.

3. COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

Compilation and installation are performed by the following commands:

> make
> make install

4. DOCUMENTATION

Optionally, you may want to generate documentation for veriT. The following
command generates both user and developer documentation:
> make doc

Note: Generation of the documentation takes much more time and space than
compilation.
