			 The veriT SMT solver
			 General informations
			
The  veriT solver  provides  a complete  satisfiability procedure  for
quantifier-free formulas  with uninterpreted functions  and difference
logic  on  real  numbers and  integers.   It  also  comes up  with  an
incomplete  procedure  for  quantified formula  through  instantiation
heuristics and  inclusion of a first-order theorem  prover.  veriT has
the capability to build proofs which  may then be reused or checked by
external tools.

veriT is available under the BSD  license.  It has a front-end for the
SMTLIB language (documented  at http://www.smtlib.org), augmented with
macro-definitions.

Compilation  and installation  instructions are  in the  INSTALL file.
Documentation  is available  in man,  html  and latex  formats in  the
directories doc/user/verit and doc/user/librv.

The following  command prints  a list of  the available options  and a
short description of each option:
verit --help
