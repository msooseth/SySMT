  \brief API for signal handling functionality.

  \note This module provides an API to centralize the signal handling
  necessities from different components. Once initialized, through
  call to veriT_signal_init, client modules may register a signal
  handler procedure and an address. The signal handler procedure
  sig_handler shall have one argument P, a pointer.

  When the program is signaled, all registered signal handling
  procedures are called with the signal and the corresponding address
  as argument.
  
  Routine veriT_signal_done shall be called to free the resources
  allocated by the module. After it has been called, the program will
  no longer react to signals with the registered signal handlers.
