  \brief API for the SMT solver VERI(T).

  This module provides satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solving
  functionality and can be accessed from any tool requiring formal 
  verification capabilities that fall within the scope of VERI(T),
  namely: quantified, or quantifier-free, first-order logic with
  uninterpreted functions, and linear arithmetics over integers
  or reals.

  The module requires that formulas representations with the TDAG type
  be built with veriT-DAG API.

   \section intro_sec Introduction

   The libveriT library provides a C-language API to access
   veriT's Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver.

   The solver is currently integrating decision procedures for the
   following: uninterpreted functions with equality, difference
   arithmetics (integers and reals), linear arithmetics (integers and
   reals). The solver integrates some level of quantifier reasoning,
   using Skolemization and instantiation heuristics based on
   triggers. The superposition-based prover E is integrated as a
   fall-back verification engine for verification conditions with a
   unique sort.

   \section install_sec Installation

   There is currently no installation procedure available for using
   veriT as a library. From the distribution, all the src directory,
   but the parsers sub-directory and the main.c file, are required to
   package veriT as a library.

   \section licence_sec Licence
    
   The library uses third-party components and, as such, is subject to some
   constraints. To relieve our potential users from such constraints we are
   providing libveriT under two licenses BSD and LGPL.

   The functionality between these licenses is the same. 

   LGPL-libveriT has arbitrary precision arithmetics.

   BSD-libveriT has fixed precision arithmetics, using native data
   types. Should overflow occur at run time, they are detected and an
   error is reported.

   \section authors_sec Authors

   Pascal Fontaine, David Deharbe are the two main developers. Diego
   Caminha has developed the difference logic verification engine
   and contributed to the design of the combination schema of the
   different "little engines" for reasoning. Thomas Bouton has
   contributed improvements to the interaction with the Boolean
   satisfiability engine as well as the QA infrastructure.
