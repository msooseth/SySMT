  Module responsible for DAG properties.

  A DAG may have properties. Property is an information that is (seldom)
  attached to some (and not all) DAGs.

  Each such property has a unique id. Properties are optional. They
  are used to implement SMT-LIB's formula annotations.  A new property
  may be created by supplying the size of the property value
  representation (in bytes) and a destructor function. The property
  value is ususally a pointer to some data structure that actually
  hold the interesting data.

  There are two pre-defined properties, identified as DAG_PROP_TRIGGER
  and DAG_PROP_NAMED.
