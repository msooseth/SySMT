  Sort unification is used to handle polymorphism.

  Sort unification is done in four steps.

  First all relevant sort unification constraints are collected in a
  list, using function DAG_sort_unif_constrain. Second DAG_sort_unif_solve
  is applied to the list. The result is the most general unifier (mgu) and
  is represented as a list of assocs with key a sort variable and
  value a sort. 

  Third, the mgu defines a sort substitution and may be applied to
  sorts and DAGs (DAG_sort_subst_DAG).

  Finally, when the mgu is no longer useful it shall be destructed
  with DAG_sort_unif_delete.
