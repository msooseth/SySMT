   \return the DAG of a formula equisatisfiable to <b>src</b> where 
   some uninterpreted constants may have been eliminated. For instance
   if the input formula is <tt>(and (= x t) (f x))</tt>, then the
   result is <tt>(f t)</tt>.

   \note Do not use with lemmas, parts of formulas, formulas with free
   variables.  Only use with a monolithic input to the prover
